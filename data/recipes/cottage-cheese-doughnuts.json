  "story": "This is a recipe from my childhood, I loved these doughnuts when I was a child. I always thought that they are rather hard to make and require a lot of time and oil :). Turns out it is not true. It took me around 30 minutes to make the doughnuts and about half a liter (or a little bit less) of canola oil - the trick is to use small saucepan.\nTip for the next time: make them smaller, aim for 40 or even more out of this amount of ingredients, they would cook faster.",
