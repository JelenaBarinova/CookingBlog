  "story": "Lately I was making a lot of these for a holiday season. In different variation: as a tart - for a dinner, as mini tarts for party, just as a casual cake. </br></br>Really easy to make, pastry can be made in advance and frozen. </br></br>The pastry is a real deal here, if you want to avoid cream - just put some peaches or plums on the crust - and I believe it'll be as good.",
