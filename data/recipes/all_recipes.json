    "story": "This is a recipe from my childhood, I loved these doughnuts when I was a child. I always thought that they are rather hard to make and require a lot of time and oil :). Turns out it is not true. It took me around 30 minutes to make the doughnuts and about half a liter (or a little bit less) of canola oil - the trick is to use small saucepan.<br /><br /> Tip for the next time: make them smaller, aim for 40 or even more out of this amount of ingredients, they would cook faster.",

    "story": "This is another recipe from my childhood. Now it is my husband's one of the most favorite dishes. I usually make more and freeze.<br /><br /> My personal improvement to the classic recipe - pesto. Before adding butter I just spread some homemade pesto onto the chicken. I serve it with mashed potatoes (half regular and half sweet) and grated carrots with dried prunes and walnuts",
