          <p>I'm Jelena, you can learn more about me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jelena.fiodorova" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>
          <p><em>Shortly,</em> I love to cook and to eat :) For more than 10 years I'm cooking at home. It slightly became my hobby. I love everything about cooking: books, tv shows, master classes - you name it. You will find recipes that I actually cook at home everyday or for special occasions.</p>
          <p>This blog is not for beginners and you will not find detailed instructions how to cook here. Mostly I write notes for myself to remember how I did the recipe and to share my favourite food ideas with my friends. </p>
          <p>And this particular version of the blog is <em>special</em> because I developed it from the scratch (I mean I wrote a code too not only recipes). So if you are more interested in software development than cooking: its RestAPI done in Node.js on a backend and AngularJS on frontend, you can find source code on github <a href="https://github.com/JelenaBarinova/CookingBlog" target="_blank">CookingBlog</a>
