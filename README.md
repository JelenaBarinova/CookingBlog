Running the App during Development

The angular-seed project comes preconfigured with a local development webserver. It is a node.js tool called http-server. You can start this webserver with npm start but you may choose to install the tool globally:

sudo npm install -g http-server
Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by running:

http-server -a localhost -p 8000
Alternatively, you can choose to configure your own webserver, such as apache or nginx. Just configure your server to serve the files under the app/ directory.
